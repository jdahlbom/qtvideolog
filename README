QtVideolog is a learning project aiming to create a video streaming
application with a futuristic UI, while learning the latest features
of Qt in the process.

QtVideolog is currently built against the Qt 4.7 technical preview,
and both incompatible backwards, and likely to be incompatible with
Qt 4.7 stable release if the planned API changes take place.
